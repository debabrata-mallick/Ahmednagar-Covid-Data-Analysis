Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus. Most people who fall infected with COVID-19 will experience light to medium symptoms and recover without special treatment. Nevertheless, some will become seriously sick or may die, so that people might need medical attention. In this pandemic situation, India faced the second-highest number of covid cases. Among them, the Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra faced a large number of covid causes and death. For analysis of Covid-19 death, we received data from the Department of Health Services, Government of Maharashtra, on 8th July 2021, on Covid cases and deaths. From the given data on Covid cases and deaths file, we analyze every fourteen talukas of Ahmednagar, which will help to improve the delivery of health services in the state of Maharashtra.
